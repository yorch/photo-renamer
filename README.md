## Overview

This tool allows you to bulk rename image files (including RAW ones) using their EXIF info, to a format containing the timestamp. For photographers aficionados, this makes it easier to sort and organize your photos, instead of keeping their original names.

So for instance, if you took a picture on Mar 31st, 2020 at 10:32:03 AM, your photo could have a name similar to `DSC_1234.jpg` (if you use Nikon cameras, Cannon use a different prefix I think but also keeping a sequence number). With this tool, your picture would be renamed to `20200331103203.jpg`.

Imagine you have 500 photos in your SD card, from different days, with a single command, all of those files would have a neat naming convention that you can use to organize them in folders, easily identify them or just sort them out.

## Docker

This tool can be build and run with Docker.

### Directly from the Docker Hub image

If you just need to run this tool on any computer with Docker installed (MacOS and Linux, since I haven't used Windows for anything serious for at least 8 years, I wouldn't know if it runs fine there too), you can run:

```sh
docker run -it -v `pwd`:/media yorch/photo-renamer /media
```

This command will rename every image in the current directory using its EXIF creation date, like: `2020033110303.jpg`, for easier sorting and photo organization.

To recursively process subdirectories, add the `--recursive` or `-r` flag:

```sh
docker run -it -v `pwd`:/media yorch/photo-renamer --recursive /media
```

> ProTip: You can create an `alias` with the previous command in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, and you would be able to call it real fast every time you need to rename your images / photos.

### Locally

To build it:

```sh
docker build . -t photo-renamer
```

And to run it:

```sh
docker run -it -v `pwd`/temp:/photos photo-renamer /photos
```

## Build

If you have Go installed, you can build the binary by running:

```sh
cd src/
go build -o renamer main.go
```

Or run:

```sh
./build-go.sh
```

You can also run the app directly by:

```sh
cd src/
go run main.go
```

## Options

The tool supports the following options:

- `--recursive` or `-r`: Recursively process subdirectories. By default, only files in the specified directory are processed.
- `--help` or `-h`: Display help information.

Example usage:

```sh
# Process only files in the current directory
./renamer /path/to/photos

# Process files in subdirectories recursively  
./renamer --recursive /path/to/photos

# Update file modification times recursively
./renamer updatemtime --recursive /path/to/photos
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add a flag to backup original files.
- [ ] Configurable naming format.
- [ ] Make updatemtime as a flag.
- [ ] Extract common logic from `renamer.go` and `update-mtime.go` into a module.
- [ ] Update Travis CI pipeline to upload compiled Go binary to Github releases.

enhanced to support images with the exact same timestamp (like when continuously shooting) and other improvements.
