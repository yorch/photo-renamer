// AskForConfirmation uses Scanln to parse user input. A user must type in "yes" or "no" and
// then press enter. It has fuzzy matching, so "y", "Y", "yes", "YES", and "Yes" all count as
// confirmations. If the input is not recognized, it will ask again. The function does not return
// until it gets a valid response from the user. Typically, you should use fmt to print out a question
// before calling AskForConfirmation. E.g. fmt.Println("WARNING: Are you sure? (yes/no)")
