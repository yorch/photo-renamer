package main

import (
	"testing"
)

// TestMain ensures the main function exists and is callable
// This is a basic smoke test for the main function
func TestMain(t *testing.T) {
	// Since main() calls cmd.Execute() which would start the CLI,
	// we can't directly test it without mocking or changing the implementation.
	// Instead, we test that the main function exists and is well-formed.
	// This test serves as a placeholder to ensure the main package is tested.
	
	// If we wanted to test main more thoroughly, we would need to refactor it
	// to be more testable, but for now this provides basic coverage.
